    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Kobe Bryant:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>August 23,1978</strong> - Born in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1996 NBA draft</strong> - Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. After the draft, the trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles. However, on June 30, Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made final on July 9, 1996, when the league's off-season moratorium ended."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1996–1999</strong> - Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Three-peat 1999–2002</strong> - Three championships were won consecutively in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this view.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Coming up short 2002–2004</strong> - With a starting lineup of O'Neal, Malone, Payton, and Bryant, the Lakers were able to reach the NBA Finals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scoring records and playoff upsets 2004–2007</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
        Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
        work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
        other applied science.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scoring records and playoff upsets 2004–2007</strong> - Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul. The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous 2003–04 season and has several criticisms of Bryant. In the book, Jackson called Bryant "un-coachable".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Back on top 2007–2010</strong> - The Lakers swept the Nuggets in the first round and on May 6, 2008, and Bryant was officially announced as the League MVP. He said, "It's been a long ride. I'm very proud to represent this organization, to represent this city.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chasing a sixth championship 2010–2013</strong> - Bryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan's total. The Lakers started the 2010–11 season by winning their first eight games. Bryant became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 26,000 career points. Bryant also recorded his first triple-double since January 21, 2009.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Injury-plagued years 2013–2015</strong> - Bryant resumed practicing in November 2013, after the 2013–2014 season had already begun. On November 25, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Lakers at an estimated value of $48.5 million. He remained the league's highest-paid player.On December 17, Bryant matched his season high of 21 points in a 96–92 win over Memphis, but he suffered a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee that was expected to sideline him for six weeks. He had played six games since returning from his Achilles injury, which included time at point guard after injuries to Nash, Steve Blake, and Jordan Farmar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Final season 2015–2016</strong> -After recovering to play in the 2015–16 preseason, Bryant suffered a calf injury and missed the final two weeks of exhibition games. However, he played in the season opener to begin his 20th season with the Lakers, surpassing John Stockton's league record of 19 for the most seasons with the same team. On November 24, 2015, the Lakers fell to 2–12 after losing 111–77 to the Warriors. Bryant scored just four points in 25 minutes on 1-for-14 shooting, matching the worst-shooting game of his career in which he attempted at least five shots. On December 1, 2015, Bryant played his last game against his hometown team, the Philadelphia 76ers, where the Lakers lost 103–91.
      </li>
      <li><strong>November 29, 2015</strong> - Bryant announced via The Players' Tribune that he would be retiring at the end of the season. In his poem titled "Dear Basketball", Bryant wrote that he fell in love with the game at age six: "A love so deep I gave you my all/From my mind & body/To my spirit & soul."

      The 2015–16 season "is all I have left to give./My heart can take the pounding/My mind can handle the grind/But my body knows it's time to say goodbye./And that's OK./I'm ready to let you go.</li>
